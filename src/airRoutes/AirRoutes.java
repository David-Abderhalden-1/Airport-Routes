/**
 * ---------------------- Air Route Flight ----------------------
 * Welcome to Air Routes. This program was designed for our final
 * mini project of Module 411 (Datastructures and Algorithms).
 * In this project we will implement a graph which contains
 * directional as well as undirectional edges. These edges
 * represent the flight routes between airports. They have given
 * weights (which can be modified).
 * With help of "Dijkstras shortest path" algorithm the user will
 * be able to calculate the most practical route.
 *
 * More Information can be found in: README.md
 * A detailed illustration of our graph can be found in: ...
