###About the project
This mini Project for TBZ Module-411 serves the purpose to use our learned skills for something practical and will
be marked in the end. We had the option to choose between seven projects:
1. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">High Score List <span style="color: orange">medium</span></div>
2. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">List of Departures  <span style="color: orange;">medium</span></div>
3. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">Web Service (with XML / Json)  <span style="color: orange;">medium</span></div>
4. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">City-Tour  <span style="color: green;">easy</span></div>
5. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">Arithmetic expressions  <span style="color: orange;">medium</span></div>
6. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">Backtracking with Recursion  <span style="color: orange;">medium</span></div>
7. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">Shortest Path -> Route-Planner  <span style="color: red;">hard</span></div>

We knew from the start that we wanted to have a go at number 7 even if it was the hardest.
The reason was that we previously discussed path finding with graphs and never really understood it.
This was the perfect opportunity to try. 

In the extended description of our project was a given route for cars. We really wanted to design 
our own plan with airports and flights (see in Files). 

During the whole project we set ourselves one more challenge. The internet should only be 
used to execute programs like "draw io", get stockfotos from usw. but __never__ to look
up code. The reason behind this goal was the following:
- We want to check how far we can go with our new knowledge of Module 411 without any help.

And it worked out surprisingly good in the end. While the code we wrote may have potential 
to improve, we are still very prod to call it our own...

###Grading:
The module 411 grading is broken into three parts. The first two are both tests about a specific
topic. Now the last one is a more interesting mini project, where we are able to show off our skills.

###More about module 411:
_We are one of the last classes to be able to experience this Module_

As the name __Algorithmics and Datastructures__ suggests is this module all about the roots of
programing. We experienced Javas most basic and also more Advanced datastructures like
HashMap / LinkedList / Stack / Queue and had the chance to implement them by our selfes. 

We also dug deeper in the field of __Recursion__ as well as __Graphs__ which we implemented in
multiple small projects. 

Over all this was e very interesting Module, full of very great knowledge.
At this point we would also like to thank our competent teacher for de great classes.
