###About the project
This mini Project for TBZ Module-411 serves the purpose to use our learned skills for something practical and will
be marked in the end. We had the option to choose between seven projects:
1. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">High Score List <span style="color: orange">medium</span></div>
2. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">List of Departures  <span style="color: orange;">medium</span></div>
3. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">Web Service (with XML / Json)  <span style="color: orange;">medium</span></div>
4. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">City-Tour  <span style="color: green;">easy</span></div>
5. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">Arithmetic expressions  <span style="color: orange;">medium</span></div>
6. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">Backtracking with Recursion  <span style="color: orange;">medium</span></div>
7. <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 300px">Shortest Path -> Route-Planner  <span style="color: red;">hard</span></div>

We knew from the start that we wanted to have a go at number 7 even if it was the hardest.
The reason was that we previously discussed path finding with graphs and never really understood it.
This was the perfect opportunity to try. 

In the extended description of our project was a given route for cars. We really wanted to design 
our own plan with airports and flights (see in Files). 

###Grading:
The module 411 grading is broken into three parts. The first two are both tests about a specific
topic. Now the last one is a more interesting mini project, where we are able to show off our skills.
